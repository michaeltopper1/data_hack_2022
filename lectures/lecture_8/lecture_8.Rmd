```

We are going to start webscraping today by doing an exercise that goes through getting information on PhD students at UCSB economics. We are going to utilize 3 main functions today in the `rvest` package:

* `rvest::read_html` - reads an html. Uses link as argument.
* `rvest::html_elements` - takes in a CSS selector as arugment and returns all elements with that selector. To be used after `read_html`
* `rvest::html_text` - gives all text inside the element above. To be used after `html_elements`

There are also a couple other functions we'll explore a little too, although these will be used far less frequently:

* `rvest::html_children` - gives all "children" of the element selected. To be used after `html_elements`
* `rvest::html_table` - specific function for gathering tables. See example.
* `rvest::html_attr` - gets a particular attribute from an element. Common are "href", "img"


A common workflow for scraping is to use the following process:

```{r, eval = F}
## common workflow - do not run
read_html(link) %>% 
  html_elements(css_selector) %>% 
  html_text()
```

We'll see this in action in the next example.

[Here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp) is a helpful link to get you familiar with html elements and attributes...because it's very easy to forget.

## Example 1: Scraping Students from UCSB

```{r}
read_html("https://econ.ucsb.edu/people/students") %>% 
  html_elements(".views-row") %>% 
  html_text(trim= T)
```

Looks pretty good right? But the trick to webscraping is to get small pieces of information at a time to avoid errors since webpages tend to have missing pieces.

Let's get the names only:

```{r}
page_info <- read_html("https://econ.ucsb.edu/people/students") %>% 
  html_elements(".views-row") %>% 
  html_elements(".group-second") %>% 
  html_text2()


## getting only people

student_info <- page_info %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  separate(value, into = c("student", "other"), sep = "\n", extra = "merge") %>% 
  extract(other, "office_number",  "(\\d\\d\\d\\d)") 
```


Now we can make some fun graphs...but for some other time:

```{r}
student_info %>% 
  count(office_number, sort = T)
```

What if we want to get the hyperlinks for each of the people?

```{r}
links <- read_html("https://econ.ucsb.edu/people/students") %>% 
  html_elements(".group-first") %>% 
  html_elements("a") %>% 
  html_attr("href") %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(link = value)
```

```{r}
## combining together
all_info <- student_info %>% 
  bind_cols(links)
```

Notice that you can image looping through all of these links and grabbing subsequent information...maybe this can be a homework assignment.

## Example 2: Craigslist Housing

We're going to use the following link:

* https://santabarbara.craigslist.org/search/apa?search_distance=15&postal=93111&min_price=&max_price=&availabilityMode=0&sale_date=all+dates


Let's try and get description, bedrooms, price and html.

Starting with description:

```{r}
description <- read_html("https://santabarbara.craigslist.org/search/apa?search_distance=15&postal=93111&min_price=&max_price=&availabilityMode=0&sale_date=all+dates") %>% 
  html_elements(".result-info") %>% 
  html_elements(".result-heading") %>% 
  html_text2() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(description = value)
```


Now let's do price:

```{r}
prices <- read_html("https://santabarbara.craigslist.org/search/apa?search_distance=15&postal=93111&min_price=&max_price=&availabilityMode=0&sale_date=all+dates") %>% 
  html_elements(".result-info") %>% 
  html_elements(".result-price") %>% 
  html_text2() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(price = value)
```


Your turn! Do bedrooms and html!

```{r}
bedrooms <- read_html("https://santabarbara.craigslist.org/search/apa?search_distance=15&postal=93111&min_price=&max_price=&availabilityMode=0&sale_date=all+dates") %>% 
  html_elements(".result-info") %>% 
  html_elements(".housing") %>% 
  html_text2() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(bedrooms = value) %>% 
  extract(bedrooms, "bedrooms", "(^\\d{1,})") %>% 
  mutate(bedrooms = readr::parse_number(bedrooms)) 
```


## Getting HTML Tables

Recall that I told you we may looks at the `html_table` function. Here's an opportunity.

Let's look at basketball data (sorry for non-sports peoples).

```{r}

read_html("https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/poolejo01/gamelog/2021") %>% 
  html_elements("#all_pgl_basic") %>%  ## get rid of this - why does this happen??
  html_table() %>% 
  pluck(1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
```
