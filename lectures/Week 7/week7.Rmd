# Create a function that is the quadratic formula, i.e., you input the coefficients of a quadratic function and the code returns the roots.

Something like: If you have the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the code will give you:

$\dfrac{- b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ and  $\dfrac{- b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

# 

# (tricky) Create a function that gives you the n-th fibonnaci number, where $n < 16$

# (trickier) Create a function that gives you the n-th fibonnaci number.
