**All submissions must be emailed to Michael Topper by 2:30pm on 6/3/22 in PDF or PowerPoint format!**

# Rules

Each of the six groups will have 15 minutes to provide a presentation on an issue occurring in California.
Their job will be to convince the panel of judges that this problem should be given substantial attention by
California policy makers. For instance, if a group decided to choose rising murder rates as their topic, their
job is to convince you that this issue is a priority because of X,Y, and Z. Students will be scored on six categories (see rubric for in-depth details):

* Presentation Acumen
* Motivation
* Figures/Tables
* Data Used
* Presentation Time
* Logical Flow/Quality of Presentation (were you convinced?)

There will be six judges: three economics faculty from UCSB and three private-sector professionals. Camilo Abbate will be keeping time on all presentations via stop-watch. Group order of presentation will be determined by randomization prior to the event. Michael will email the students at 2:45pm on June 3rd with the ordering. 

Prizes are as follows:

* 1st Prize: $500 Amazon Gift Card
* 2nd Prize: $200 Amazon Gift Card
* 3rd Prize: $100 Amazon Gift Card
