**Topic: What topic should be on the top of California policy makers agenda and why?**

Each of the six groups will have 15 minutes to provide a presentation on an issue occurring in California. Their job is to convince the panel of judges that this problem should be given substantial attention by California policy makers. For instance, if a group decided to choose rising murder rates as their topic, their job is to convince you that this issue is a priority because of X,Y, and Z.

Below is a rubric containing elements upon groups should be judged.
